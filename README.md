Credit Card Customer Analysis
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of credit card customers, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling. The goal is to uncover insights into customer behaviors, identify distinct customer segments, and develop models to predict customer churn.
